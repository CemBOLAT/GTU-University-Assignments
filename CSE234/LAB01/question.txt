The problem is to show how many ones (1s) a given number contains by looking at its bits.
The given number is 4-bits and is taken by switches on FPGA.
If the given number contains an odd number of 1s the led should be on, otherwise, the LED is off.

For example; input:0010 then this number contains only one 1, so the output led is on.
Input:0011, this number contains two 1s, so this is an even number, the led is off.
