The program initialize with 10 user for testing easily.
I think the taking timestamps from user makes no sense when our name is unique as we use map.
Hence, I dont take timestamps from user.
Me and my friends haven't notice it before the p.s. section,
So I write the readme and put it on my report to clarify.
