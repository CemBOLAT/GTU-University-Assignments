# I used .PHONY rule to declare as function
# I mean when I use <compile> rule in this makefile I need requirements which are main.c part1.c ...
# Before the checking requirements system checks does this folder has a file or folder as rules name <compile> in this example
# To ignore that I add .PHONY rule thats why I mentioned it as a function
